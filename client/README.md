# Client Setup with Vite and Vue

This guide covers the installation steps to set up the frontend environment in the `client` folder using Vite and Vue.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

## Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the Client Folder**  
   First, navigate to the `client` folder in your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/project/client

    Install Dependencies
    Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies, including Vite and Vue:

    bash

npm install

Start the Development Server
Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server with:

bash

npm run dev

After running this, Vite will start the server and provide a local URL (typically http://localhost:3000) where you can view the app.
